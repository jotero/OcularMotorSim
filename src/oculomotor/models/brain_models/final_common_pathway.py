"""Final common pathway — version+vergence  →  motor neurons  →  output nerves.

Anatomically faithful chain:

    version_vergence (6,)
        ↓ M_NUCLEUS                  (signed nucleus drives)
        ↓ × g_nucleus                (nuclear lesion: multiplicative cell-count gain)
        ↓ MLF tract (axon)           (AIN MN → contralateral CN3_MR MN; cap = g_mlf · NERVE_MAX)
        ↓ M_NERVE_PROJ × 2           (nucleus → MN target firing rate)
        ↓ MN intrinsic f-I curve     (biophysical max NERVE_MAX, not a lesion knob)
    motor neurons (12 dynamic states, x_mn)
        ↓ tau_mn LP dynamics         (~5 ms membrane TC)
        ↓ axonal conduction clip     (cap = g_nerve · NERVE_MAX, frequency-selective)
    output nerves (12,) → extraocular muscles

The MLF is a motor-neuron-to-motor-neuron connection: abducens internuclear
neurons (AIN) fire as ordinary MNs (intrinsic NERVE_MAX), their axons enter
the contralateral MLF tract (conduction-capped), and they synapse onto CN3_MR
motoneurons in the oculomotor nucleus.  CN3_MR motoneurons sum vergence drive
(direct from supraoculomotor area) with MLF input → fire → drive MR muscle.

Lesion semantics:

    g_nucleus (12,)  Multiplicative gain on signed nucleus drive.
                     Models cell loss in a nucleus (% of cells surviving).
                     Burst AND tonic both attenuated proportionally.
                     ABN gain shared with co-located AIN (intermingled populations).

    g_mlf_L/R (2,)   Conduction cap on the MLF axon tract (axon-level clip).
                     Models demyelination / conduction block in the MLF.
                     Frequency-selective: tonic AIN drive (small) gets through;
                     saccadic burst (large) is capped → slow adducting saccades.
                     Vergence preserved (delivered via CN3_MR direct, bypasses MLF).

    g_nerve (12,)    Conduction cap on the cranial-nerve axon (axon-level clip).
                     Models nerve demyelination / fascicular lesion.
                     Frequency-selective: fixation hold preserved, burst clipped
                     → limited-motility ophthalmoplegia.  At g_nerve=0 the axon
                     transmits nothing → complete muscle paralysis.

                              LR_R, MR_R, SR_R, IR_R, SO_R, IO_R]

Parameters (in BrainParams):
