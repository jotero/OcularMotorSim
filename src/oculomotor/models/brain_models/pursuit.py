"""Smooth pursuit SSM — bilateral leaky integrator + Smith predictor.

Drives smooth eye movements to track a moving target.  Receives the EC-corrected
target slip (target_slip_ec ≈ v_target) and outputs a pursuit velocity command
that feeds into the neural integrator (NI).

Bilateral (push-pull) architecture
----------------------------------
Real MT / MST has direction-selective populations: rightward-preferring cells
fire for rightward target motion, leftward-preferring cells for leftward.
We split the pursuit integrator into two non-negative populations:

    x_R  (3,)  — rightward / upward / extorting pursuit memory
    x_L  (3,)  — leftward  / downward / intorting pursuit memory

Each population leaks with τ_pursuit and integrates the rectified part of
the Smith-predictor error:

    e_pred  =  (target_slip_ec − x_net) / (1 + K_phasic)
    dx_R/dt =  −x_R / τ  +  K_pursuit · max(0,  e_pred)
    dx_L/dt =  −x_L / τ  +  K_pursuit · max(0, −e_pred)

The NET pursuit memory drives the eye:

    x_net      = x_R − x_L
    u_pursuit  = x_net + K_phasic · e_pred

Identity check.  Because  max(0, e) − max(0, −e) = e  for any signed e,
the net dynamics dx_net/dt = −x_net/τ + K_pursuit · e_pred are EQUAL to the
single-integrator case.  Bilateralisation preserves the closed-form Smith
predictor and steady-state pursuit gain — it just exposes the per-side
populations as separate states.

Why bilateralise — clinical motivation
--------------------------------------
- Unilateral cerebellar / MT lesion → asymmetric pursuit gain (e.g. reduced
  rightward gain only).  In the single-integrator model you can only scale
  K_pursuit globally — no way to model directional asymmetry.
- With per-side populations, downstream lesion gains can target one side
  (g_pursuit_R, g_pursuit_L — future per-side gains, not implemented yet).

Smith predictor (closed-form, no circularity)
----------------------------------------------
    u_pu_now      = x_net + K_phasic · e_pred             (current motor output)
    e_pred        = target_slip_ec − u_pu_now             (Smith: error = ref − output)
    →  e_pred = (target_slip_ec − x_net) / (1 + K_phasic) (solved explicitly)

EC correction in VS
-------------------
brain_model feeds u_burst + u_pursuit into the EC cascade.
VS receives slip_delayed + scene · motor_ec_okr → cancels self-generated OKR.
Pursuit receives target_slip + motor_ec_pursuit → cancels self-generated pursuit.

Parameters (in BrainParams)
---------------------------
    K_pursuit         integration gain (1/s).  TC ≈ 1/K_pursuit (open-loop).
    K_phasic_pursuit  direct feedthrough (dim'less); sets Smith attenuation.
    tau_pursuit       leak TC (s).  Steady-state pursuit gain:
                          gain ≈ K_p·τ·(1+K_ph) / [(1+K_ph)² + K_p·τ]
                      With K_pursuit=4, K_phasic=5, tau_pursuit=40 s → ~98.8 %
