"""Brain model — velocity storage, neural integrator, saccade generator, efference copy,
gravity estimator, smooth pursuit, and vergence.

Aggregates all brain subsystems into a single SSM with one state vector and one
step() function.

Signal flow:
    y_canals         (6,)   canal afferents                   → VS
    slip             (3,)   delayed raw retinal slip           → VS (after EC)
    target_slip      (3,)   delayed target velocity on retina  → pursuit (Smith predictor)
    e_cmd            (3,)   motor error command                → SG
    pos_L/R          (3,)   per-eye delayed position error     → vergence

EC delay cascades live inside the cerebellum module (cb), since they ARE
the cerebellum's forward-model output (a delayed prediction of the retinal
self-motion contribution).  Two paths run in parallel:
    acts.cb.ec_scene  = delayed EC matched to scene_angular_vel cascade
    acts.cb.ec_target = delayed EC matched to target_vel cascade

    OKR / VS correction  — scene-gated (full scene slip):
        okr = scene_visible · (slip + acts.cb.ec_scene)
        slip ≈ −(u_burst+u_pursuit)(t−τ)  →  corrected ≈ 0  ✓

    Pursuit cerebellar drive — target-gated trust signal applied internally:
        cerebellum exposes acts.cb.drive (gated forward-model prediction);
        pursuit input = K_pursuit_direct·target_slip + acts.cb.drive
        Implicit cancellation of self-motion via target_slip ≈ −ec_target
        (delayed by the same cascade).

Vergence (Schor 1986 dual integrator + Robinson direct phasic path):
    e_disp = pos_L − pos_R   (binocular disparity, deg)
    u_phasic = K_phasic_verg · e_disp                     (deg/s, no state)
    dx_v       = −x_v / τ_verg + K_verg · e_disp                       (vergence integrator)
    dx_v_tonic = −x_v_tonic / τ_verg_tonic + K_verg_tonic · e_disp     (tonic vergence integrator)
    u_verg   = tonic_verg + x_fast + x_slow + τ_vp · u_phasic
    motor_cmd_L = motor_cmd_version + ½ · u_verg   (L eye converges rightward)
    motor_cmd_R = motor_cmd_version − ½ · u_verg   (R eye converges leftward)

Cerebellum cascade advance (end of step):
    dcb = cb.step(brain_state.cb, ec_vel, ec_pos, brain_params)
    where ec_vel = u_burst + u_pursuit + omega_tvor (version velocity command).

Internal flow:
    VS  →  w_est  →  −w_est + u_burst + u_pursuit  →  NI  →  motor_cmd_version
    SG  →  u_burst    (saccade burst → cerebellum EC cascade)
    Pursuit → u_pursuit  (→ NI + cerebellum EC cascade)
    cerebellum → delays (u_burst + u_pursuit + omega_tvor) by tau_vis;
                  ec_scene used by VS (scene path);
                  ec_target used by pursuit forward model (drive output)
    GE  →  g_est (gravity estimate, cross-product dynamics)
    Vergence → u_verg → split ±½ to L/R motor commands

Brain state — `BrainState` NamedTuple, perception → motor order:
    pc   — perception_cyclopean (binocular fusion + brain LP)
    sm   — self-motion observer (VS bilateral pops + GE + HE)
    pt   — target perception working memory
    sg   — saccade generator (e_held + OPN + accumulators + EBN/IBN)
    pu   — bilateral pursuit pops
    va   — vergence + accommodation
    ni   — bilateral NI pops + null adaptation
    fcp  — motor neurons (final common pathway)
    cb   — cerebellum (EC cascades + pursuit forward model)

Each subsystem owns its own `State` NamedTuple; `BrainState` aggregates them
under named fields.  No flat-array layout — read fields directly via
`brain_state.<sub>.<field>`.  `N_STATES` (≈193) is kept for legacy info only
and is computed from the sub-SSM sizes — never hand-maintain it.
