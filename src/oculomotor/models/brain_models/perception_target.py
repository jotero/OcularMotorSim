"""Target perception — FEF/dlPFC working memory feeding the saccade generator.

Pursuit drive (post-delay EC subtraction + magnitude/directional gates) used
to live here but moved into `cerebellum.py` (pursuit region — paraflocculus
ventral / vermis VI–VII).  This module now owns only the working-memory layer
that lets brief target flashes drive a saccade after the flash ends, and that
decays slowly when the target is gone.

Component (working memory):
  4-state cognitive layer (3-D last-seen position + trust scalar).  The SG
  uses these to fire a saccade toward the remembered location after the
  flash ends.  Memory drains proportional to |ec_d_target|, so any eye
  movement (saccade, fast pursuit, head-impulse fast-phase) consumes the
  memory and prevents re-triggering on the residual.

State layout (N_STATES = 4):
    x_target_mem = [x_mem_pos (3) | trust (1)]

Outputs of step():
    dstate         pt.State derivative
    tgt_pos_eff   (3,)   blended raw + memory target position → SG
    tgt_vis_eff   scalar blended visibility                   → SG
