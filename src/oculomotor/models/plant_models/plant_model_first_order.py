"""Plant model — extraocular muscles and globe (Level 1b: 3-D linear).

Level 1b: three independent first-order LP filters, one per rotational axis
(yaw, pitch, roll).  All axes share the same time constant τ_p.  No
cross-axis coupling, no muscle geometry.  Simple and gradient-friendly.

First-order plant model: Robinson (1964 IEEE Trans Biomed Eng; 1981 Ann Rev
Neurosci). The pulse-step input architecture (NI feedthrough tau_p) that
cancels the plant lag is from Robinson (1975).

    dx_p/dt = clip_wall((motor_cmd − x_p) / τ_p)   (wall-clipped velocity)
    q_eye   = x_p                                   (state IS the bounded position)
    w_true  = dx_p                                  (consistent with q_eye)

The orbital walls are enforced by zeroing dx_p whenever x_p is at ±L and
the velocity would push it further outside.  This keeps x_p within [−L, +L]
so q_eye = x_p directly, and w_true = dx_p is always consistent with q_eye.

Binocular layout:
    The top-level `State` NamedTuple has `left` and `right` fields, each a
    (3,) eye rotation vector.  `step()` operates on a single (3,) eye; the
    simulator calls it twice (once per eye field) and packs both into a
    fresh `State`.

State:   x_p  (3,)  eye rotation vector (deg), bounded within ±orbital_limit
Input:   motor_cmd  (3,)  pulse-step motor command from NI
Outputs: q_eye  (3,)  eye rotation vector (= x_p)
         w_true (3,)  instantaneous eye angular velocity (deg/s) (= dx_p)

Parameters:
  τ_p — plant time constant (s). Typical: 0.15 s (Robinson 1981; Goldstein
        1983 Biol Cybern).
  orbital_limit — mechanical half-range (deg). Default: 50 deg.
